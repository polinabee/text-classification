# Text Classification with Neural Networks
text classification using neural networks, for computational machine learning.
Word- and character- wise models, exploring differences between CNN, LSTM, and RNN.

The complete notebook is called text-classification-nn. The other files contain helper functions that I used in development for parts of the final models.
